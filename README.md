# Sales-Data-Analysis
Sales Data Analysis using PySpark

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project provides an end-to-end data analysis of the Adidas sales dataset. The primary objective is to process and analyze sales data to uncover key business insights and performance metrics. By leveraging the power of PySpark and Spark SQL for big data processing, the project calculates crucial KPIs like total sales, operating profit, and units sold. These metrics are then broken down by various dimensions—including region, state, product, and sales method—to identify trends and support strategic business decision-making. The final analysis is presented through a series of visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
